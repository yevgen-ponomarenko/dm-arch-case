brand with premium experience visiting fitness centers around the World.

the financial year in US and Mexico. And later exposure to German, UK, and Western Europe in 2021.
For end users the membership provides ability to visit any fitness center in the Life1 network.
The benefit of centers to join the Life1 network is to access to global marketing program and to develop 
software what helps to grow the client base and sell ancillary goods.

Currently all operations (visits, purchases of the memberships, buying supplementary goods and others)
are managed through Excel files and the phone.

Life1 does not have any specific preferences in target technology, however, would like to invest into
