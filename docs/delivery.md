We recommend to plan for 2 delivery cycles.
Overall supervision to be executed by *Governance Team*

### Cycle 1 - fitness centers management in cloud
To maintain business continuity we recommend to move fitness centers management data and operation into the cloud .
Initially, it would maintain an existing excel data upload flow via AWS File Transfer (FTPS) approach. Then new flow using web-facing solution to be implemented.
Owners of the business will be able to receive a 360 operational view.
